            <h3>About myself:</h3>
            <p>
                My name is Philpp Gerstl. I am 21 years of age and I live in Kirchberg ob der Donau which lies in the
                beautiful MÃ¼hlviertel. I've been living there since 2009 since we had to move away from Linz because I
                have 4 siblings (2 pairs of twins) and my, at that time single, mum couldn't afford a flat in Linz. My
                family and I love cats, and we pretty much had at least 1-4 cats ever since we moved. 1 Year ago I got
                my license and my grandma gifted me her old car, which is a 2005 Golf 4 420.000 km on it, but still
                drives like a charm.

            <h3 id="motivation">Motivation for IT:</h3>
            <p>
                I've been interested in IT pretty much since middleschool. I always loved to fiddle around with
                computer, whether I build them or switched out broken parts, I just loved doing some on-hand work. It
                has been a dream for a while to get a job in IT, but never really had the chance to. Thankfully because
                of my unemployment and an AMS-Course I got the opportunity to come to Codersbay and learn how to code,
                which I had no idea of beforehand. So basically my motivation is to one day help people with website or
                app needs, to make their Imagination a reality.

            <h3 id="freetime">Free-time/Interests</h3>
            <p>
                In my free-time I love to play video games such as Shooters, Puzzle games or some silly and fun Koop
                games
                with my friends. Music is also a big passion of mine. I went to a music-middleschool where I learnt a
                lot
                about music theory and simply how music works. So, every now and then, if I have any ideas I like to
                produce
                music with FL-Studio. My favorite genre to produce is Drum and Bass because I simply just love this
                genre.
                It is filled with emotion, passion and drive. The music also brings so many people together who love to
                enjoy some bangers. When I have the financial ability I also love to upgrade my home pc-setup since
                parts
                and peripherals improve a lot over time, so I somewhat like to stay up-to-date.

            <p>
                Since I've only been in codersbay for 3 weeks I don't really have any projects, but here are some
                examples
                of what we did so far:
